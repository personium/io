## Note

	This project started as a proprietary service platform development
	to accelerate Fujitsu's social innovations business.

	As of Dec. 2014, this project is still on the way from properietary
	to open source, and thus this product is not ready to be comfortably
	used by everyone yet.

	We are going to prepare missing parts, e.g. documents, tools, etc.,
	to resolve this situation as soon as possible.
